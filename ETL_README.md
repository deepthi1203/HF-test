# Data Processing and Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for processing and analyzing recipe data using Apache Spark. This Document consists two main tasks:
1. **Processing Recipes**: Reading JSON files, cleaning the data, and writing the output to an S3 bucket in Parquet format.
2. **Analyzing Recipes**: Reading the Parquet file, filtering and transforming the data, and writing the results to an S3 bucket in CSV format.

## Task 1: Processing Recipes

### Approach / Steps
1. **Initialize Spark Session**: Create and setup the Spark session to manage the Spark application with the necessary configurations.
2. **Input Path Validation**: Check if the input path exists and contains JSON files.
3. **Read JSON Files**: Load the JSON files into a Spark DataFrame.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Drop rows with null values and convert the `datePublished` column to date type.
5. **Write Output**: Write the cleaned DataFrame to an S3 bucket in Parquet format.

## Task 2: Analyzing Recipes

### Approach / steps
1. **Initialize Spark Session**: Create and setup the Spark session to manage the Spark application with the necessary configurations.
2. **Read Parquet File**: Load the Parquet file into a Spark DataFrame.
3. **Data Filtering**: Filter recipes containing 'beef' in the ingredients.
4. **Time Calculations**: Extract and convert cookTime and prepTime to minutes.
5. **Total Cook Time**: Calculate the total cook time using total cook time = cook time + prep time.
6. **Difficulty Level**: Determine the difficulty level based on total cook time, if total cook time< 30 then easy, if total cook time is in between 30 and 60 then medium, if total cook time > 60 them hard.
7. **Average Cook Time**: Calculate the average cooking time as per difficulty level means grouping the data based on difficulty level and performing average.
8. **Write Output**: Write the result DataFrame to an S3 bucket in CSV format.

## Additional Considerations

### Data Quality Checks
Implemented data quality checks which ensures the integrity of datasets. This includes validating the presence of required columns, checking for empty DataFrames, and ensuring data types are correct.

### CI/CD Implementation
To implement CI/CD, we can use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. These tools automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are reliably integrated and deployed.

### Diagnosing and Tuning Performance
To diagnose and tune performance, consider the following:
- **Monitoring**: We can use Spark UI to monitor job execution and identify bottlenecks.
- **Caching**: Cache intermediate DataFrames if they are reused multiple times.
- **Partitioning**: Ensure data is partitioned appropriately to avoid data skew.
- **Resource Allocation**: Adjust executor memory and cores based on the workload.
